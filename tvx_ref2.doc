                  *** USER CUSTOMIZATION of TVX ***
 
     A program called TVX_CFG is also provided with most versions of
Standard TVX.  It allows you to customize TVX to a great extent.  The
program generates a file called CONFIG.TVX.  When TVX is started with
a command line of the form: 'TVX filename -c=config.tvx", the values
defined in CONFIG.TVX will be used instead of the defaults.  (Warning:
TVX_CFG may not be implemented for all systems.  It does not work with
the emulator versions of TVX.)
 
     TVCONFIG is mostly self explanatory.  It allows you to change the
following:
 
1. Commands.  All of the approximately 50 commands can be redefined.
There are some restrictions: all commands must be a single letter, and
case is ignored.  The '@', ESCAPE, and '<>' commands cannot be
changed.  Commands cannot be a number, including a '-'. 
 
2. Synonyms.  You may define some synonyms, such as space for right,
or RETURN for down.  You cannot duplicate previously defined
commands. 
 
3. Function Keys.  Up to 50 function keys may be defined to be
equivalent to any command (in fact any letter or character).  When a
function key is pressed, TVX will translate it to the character you
specify.  If your function keys use an ESCAPE as a prefix character,
you will have to redefine a function key to be ESCAPE! 
 
4. Parameters.  You may change the default for any of the ':'
parameters. 
 
     After you have built a suitable working version of CONFIG.TVX,
another program called TVX_PTCH has been provided to allow TVX.EXE (or
TVX.COM) to be permanently patched with the options set by TVX_CFG.
This means you won't have keep track of the CONFIG.TVX file any more,
and won't need the '-c' switch.

                        *** Error Messages ***
 
*** Abort, are you sure? 
     This message is displayed after the "abort" command has been
entered.  A reply of y or Y will cause the session to be terminated. 
 
*** Bad O= switch
     An incorrect format was specified for the O= switch. 
 
*** Bad @ name
     An invalid file name was specified.  Re-enter. 
 
*** Bad command: x
     The command is not a valid TVX command. 
 
*** Bad file name
     An invalid file name was specified.  Re-enter. 
 
*** Bad output file: filename
     An invalid output file was specified. 
 
*** Bad par (val | name)
     An invalid value or parameter name was specified. 
 
*** Bad rpt buff #
     An invalid repeat loop number was entered. 
 
*** Bad switch
     An invalid switch was specified.  Re-enter file name and
switches. 
 
*** buffer empty
     Information message.  Displayed after a new file has been
created, or when the write buffer command is executed and the text
buffer is empty. 
 
*** Can't create new name
     TVX was unable to create a new name for the output file.  Free
some disk space, rename the file, try again. 
 
*** Can't insert that
     There are three values that TVX uses internally, and thus are not
valid as user inserted characters in the text buffer. 
 
*** Can't save last line twice! 
     The last line of the buffer can only be saved once.  (That
applies to the other lines, too, but the last line is a special case.)
 
*** Can't :o, R/O
     It makes no sense to set a new file name when the file is read
only. 
 
*** Can't, buffer empty.  Insert 1st
     Most TVX commands are not valid until some text has been inserted
into the buffer.

*** Can't: R/O
     File beginning is illegal when the file is read only. 
 
*** Compacting buffer
     Information message.  Displayed when TVX is compacting the
buffer.  The compaction process may take several seconds. 
 
*** Compacting done
     Information.  The compaction is complete. 
 
*** Compactor lost: quit now! 
     An internal error has been discovered.  Exit TVX immediately, and
preserve the backup copy.  Try the session again. 
 
*** Create?  (y/n)
     The file name specified does not exist.  A y answer will cause
the file to be created.  A n answer will allow the file name to be
respecified. 
 
*** Error reopening
     Something has gone wrong with the 'File beginning' command.
Exit, and try editing the file again.  Be careful since an empty file
may have been created. 
 
*** File only part read
     There was not enough room in the save buffer to hold the entire
external file specified in the 'merge' command.  Try re-editing using
the 's' big buffer switch. 
 
*** Line no longer there
     Return to noted location can't work because the noted line has
been deleted. 
 
*** lines filled
     TVX has run out of room to add more lines.  Use the 'write
buffer' or 'file beginning' command to get more space for new lines. 
 
*** no get room
     There is not enough room in the text buffer to insert all the
text in the save buffer.  Use the 'file begin' or 'write buffer'
commands, and try again.  The '-^W' command is often useful. 
 
*** no more lines for insert
     See "lines filled". 
 
*** no nesting
     TVX does not allow nested repeat loops: "<<..>>". 
 
*** no save room
     There is not enough room left to save any more text in the save
buffer.  Try saving smaller blocks, or use the 'file begin' command to
get more space. 
 
*** No more free lines for insert
     The maximum number of lines have been used.  Write the buffer
before inserting more new lines.

*** not found
     The current find pattern was not found. 
 
*** Not a valid rpt buff
     The current line does not contain a valid repeat loop for the ^R
restore command to use. 
 
*** reading file... 
     Displayed while TVX is reading in the file. 
 
*** rename fails
     Something has gone wrong with the 'File beginning' or 'quit'
commands.  On timeshared systems, this may mean you didn't have write
capability for the file.  The work file will probably be retained, and
can be manually renamed or copied using standard operating system
commands. 
 
*** search fails
     A cross-buffer search has failed to find pattern. 
 
*** Save buffer empty! 
     Tried to write to a file when save buffer empty. 
 
*** Unable to open external file
     An invalid name was specified. 
 
*** Unable to open yank file
     An invalid name was specified. 
 
*** writing buffer
     Displayed when the buffer is being written out. 
 
*** writing partial buffer
     Partial buffer only, as caused by the '-^W' command. 
 
*** Yank filename:
     Enter the name of the file you want to read into the save
buffer. 
 
*** 100 chars only
     At most, 100 characters are allowed in each find pattern and each
repeat loop. 
 
*** <> not complete
     The repeat loop has terminated before the specified number times
have been executed.  This is usually what you wanted, and can be
caused by failing to find a pattern, or reaching the end of the
buffer.  An invalid command or other error will also cause a repeat
loop to terminate.

                           *** TTY MODE ***
 
     Normally, TVX is uses as a full screen editor.  It will work on
dumb crt terminals or on hard copy terminals, however.  The alternate
mode of operation is called tty mode.  Tty mode is also useful for
terminals hooked up with slow baud rates.  Almost all TVX commands are
supported in tty mode.  The main difference is that the editor no
longer operates in a what you see is what you get mode. 
 
     When TVX is first started in tty mode (either by the -t command
line switch, or using 1:t), it will display a 'tvx>' prompt.  The
normal mnemonic commands are then entered on the input line.  The
input line is terminated by a <return> (which is not sent as a
command).  Each letter on the input line will be interpreted as a TVX
command.  Thus, entering a line: 'dddr' would move the cursor 3 lines
down and one character right.  The result of the commands will not be
displayed however. 
 
     The 'V' verify command operates specially for tty mode, and is
used to type out lines of the file.  The normal procedure, then is to
enter commands on the command input line, then enter appropriate 'V'
commands to display relevant lines of the buffer. 
 
     As long as normal TVX commands are entered, the command line
prompt is 'tvx>', and the terminating <return> sends commands to TVX
to execute.  In insert, find, and repeat, the prompt will change to
'+'.  All text entered, including <return>'s is entered into the text,
the find pattern, or the repeat loop buffer.  An Escape ends the
command, and an additional <return> sends the line to TVX. 
 
     Why is tty mode included in TVX?  The earliest versions of TVX
had tty mode because there were a lot of TI Silent-700's around used
at 300 baud.  No longer.  One reason is that tty mode provides an
interface useful to visually handicapped users.  The other is that it
is useful for certain things not possible in visual mode.  For
example, suppose you wanted to see every line in a file containing a
certain pattern.  Tty mode is useful for this.  Enter tty mode (1:t),
then enter the following loop after the 'tvx>' prompt:
     1000<fpattern$vd>$$
This command will find the pattern, print the line, and go to the next
line to search again.  Failure on the last find will exit the loop.
There are no doubt other subtle tricks like this that tty mode can be
used for.

                     *** INSTALLATION OF TVX ***
 
     If you have the C source code of TVX, this section has some notes
you should find useful if you recompile the code to customize TVX for
your system.  It should also be helpful if you are installing TVX on a
new system.  If you are just a user, then you can ignore this
section. 
 
 
*** General Comments ***
 
     TVX has been designed to be portable.  It has had versions
running under CP/M-80, MS-DOS, GEMDOS, RT-11, RSX-11, VMS, and Unix
BSD 4.2.  The heart of TVX portability is the terminal driver.  For
dedicated systems, the control codes used by a specific terminal are
hard wired into C global variables and a terminal specific version is
compiled.  It has been customary to give a unique name to each
different version such as TVV for a VT-52 version, TVT for a televideo
version, etc.  The Unix 4.2 BSD version of TVX has been written to
take advantage of the TERMCAP library usually provided, and is thus
terminal independent. 
 
     Since terminals differ widely, TVX tries to update the screen as
best as possible using the control codes available.  The minimum set
of control sequences required by TVX include direct x-y cursor
positioning, and erase from cursor to the end of the current line.
Almost all terminals have at least these two controls.  The only known
terminal widely available that does not have both of these is the
ADM-3a.  Thus, TVX will NOT work on ADM-3a's.  Another desirable
control sequence is the ability to insert a blank line at the top of
the screen (reverse scroll).  This allows TVX to scroll rather than
jump from one screen to the next.  However, TVX will perform
adequately even on terminals with only x-y and erase to end of line.
It has also been found that TVX does not always work on terminals with
multiple pages of screen data.  The scroll bottom line command usually
fails. 
 
*** Quick and Dirty Porting ***
 
     It should be very simple to port TVX to a new machine for a
pecific terminal.  The only "hard" part comes when trying to use a
package like TERMCAP.  Then, the 4.2 Unix code can serve as a guide.
In effect, what that code does is get the screen controls and patch
the regular TVX screen control locations. 
 
     Typically, however, it should be almost trivial (assuming a
fairly standard C implementation - the current code compiles unchanged
on 4 different C compilers) to generate a version of TVX for a
specific terminal.  The main steps:
 
     1. Define the control codes for the terminal.  These are
explained in some detail in the manual. 
 
     2. Fix file I/O calls.  This may take no changes at all.  The
main issue has been the mode argument to fopen.  TVX likes to get the
file raw - with NO end of line handling by the C I/O system.  These

TVX Reference Manual                                           2/25/86
 
 
things are identified by #define's in tvx_defs.ic.  The other issue is
what is the end of line character.  Unix likes LF only, while MS-DOS
and descendants like CR/LF (actually DEC RT-11 descendants).  The
#define FILELF and NEWLINE handle this. 
 
     3. The last issue is getting characters to and from the
terminal.  These are isolated in tvx_io.c.  The critical routines:
 
     ttrd() [ and ttrd_() ]: This reads one character (ANY possible
character, except possible ^S and ^Q) from the terminal, UNECHOED.
The routine ttinit is called to possibly initialize things, and ttclos
at the end to undo whatever ttinit did. 
 
     ttwt() and ttwtln(): These are used to send characters to the
screen.  ttwt sends a single character, immediately and unbuffered.
ttwtln can be based on ttwt, but is provided and used whenever a chunk
is available to write.  This is essential on busy time shared
systems. 
 
     That's really the only problem areas.  One good thing to do when
porting is to find all the uses of #ifdef (and #ifndef) for the
implementations described: MSDOS, UNIX, GEMDOS.  Those certainly
identify the areas most likely to be different on your system. 
 
     Note that the Microsoft C compiler for MS-DOS is slightly brain
damaged - the arguments to rename in its library are backwards from
the rest of the world. 
 
 
*** Source Files Supplied ***
 
     The following files are included in most distributions:
 
  TVX_1.C  - main part of code (part 1)
  TVX_2.C  - main part of code (part 2)
             These two files are mostly os and terminal independent.

               make generating new emulators easy.  When generating
               a new emulator, only TVX_EDIT and TVX_LEX need to
               be recompiled.

  TVX_LIB.C - misc library routines needed by TVX.
  TVX_IBM.C - IBM-PC specific code, specifically the screen driver
              (TVX_IBM.ASM - hand optimized version of TVX_IBM.C)
  TVX_UNIX.C - contains unix specific code, including termcap driver
  TVX_DEFS.IC - #define's for version, os, terminal, defaults
  TVX_GLBL.IC - global data structures
  TVX_TERM.IC - definitions for various terminals and systems

  TVX_CFG.C - used to build CONFIG.TVX file for -c switch
  TVX_PTCH.C - MS-DOS versions only - used to permanently apply
              config settings to TVX.EXE.

*** Screen Driver and Control Sequences ***
 
     The actual codes used by TVX to update the screen are global
variables in the 'tvx_glbl.ic' file.  Using the '#ifdef EXTERN' trick
described in that file, the screen variables (plus most other relevant
global variables) are included as external references.  The actual
definitions for a given terminal are included in a file called
'tvx_term.ic'.  Several sample definitions are included in the
distribution code.  A description of each relevant variable follows:
 
 
** X-Y Cursor Addressing
 
int addx - amount to add to internal x position get terminal's x
value.  Terminals typically encode x-y as a single printable
character, thus requiring the addition of a blank to make x-y
printable.  Since TVX uses a 1,1 origin, this value will commonly be
31. 
 
int addy - same as addx, but for y position. 
 
char cxychr - true (1) if convert xy binary representation to ascii
string. 
 
char cxy1st - 'l' if line coordinate first, 'c' if column first. 
 
char cxybeg[8], char cxymid[8], char cxyend[8] - The x-y cursor
control sequence usually takes one of two forms: <control><x><y> or
<control><x><middle><y><end>.  The x and y may be reversed.  These
three arrays are used to send the proper control sequence for xy
positioning. 
 
 
*** Other control sequences
 
char cversn[12] - a version string to identify terminal. 
 
char cerrbg[8], char cerred[8] - sequences sent when an error message
sent to terminal's last line.  Note that cerrbe is sent BEFORE the
cursor is moved to the last line, and cerred is sent before the cursor
is returned to the original position.  Some terminals give problems if
a highlight sequence is sent before a cursor positioning sequence.  A
bell is usually safe for most versions. 
 
char ctopb[8] - This sequence should insert a blank line when the
cursor is at the top left corner.  It is often called reverse line
feed.  A command to insert a line usually performs the same function,
but some terminals don't have both. 
 
 
                                 -29-
 
 
 
 
TVX Reference Manual                                           2/25/86
 
 
char cinit[20], char cendit[20] - these sequences are sent to
initialize and reset the terminal. 
 
char cbotb[8] - this sequence scrolls the screen up one line when the
cursor is on the last line.  Line feed works for any terminal
encountered to date. 
 
char celin[8] - Erase from cursor to end of line.  This sequence is
required for operation of TVX. 
 
char cescr[8] - Erase from cursor to end of screen.  If the terminal
doesn't have this, it is simulated using multiple celins. 
 
char ccsrcm[8], char ccsrin[8] - These are used to change the cursor
from command mode to insert mode.  Many terminals do not support a
method of changing the cursor shape.  These have been also been used
to change the screen from normal to reverse video and back. 
 
char ciline[8] - Insert a blank line.  A blank line is inserted on the
line the cursor is on.  If available, it can be used for ctopb, too. 
 
char ckline[8] - Kill a line.  The line the cursor is on is deleted,
and the following text scrolled up. 
 
char cundlb[8], cundle[8] - TVX has the capability to optionally
support bold and underline for some text processors.  For example, a
^U can be used to toggle underscore.  This is only useful for a text
formatter that can recognize such a sequence. 
 
char cboldb[8], char cbolde[8] - Similar to undlb, but boldface. 
 
 
*** Default settings
 
int ddline - default display line.  This sets which line is the
default home display line.  For scrolling versions (dscrl != 0), right
in the middle is a good place.  For fixed cursor line versions,
something below the middle seems better (like 16 for 24 line
screens). 
 
int dscrl - default scroll lines.  If this is non-zero, the cursor
will move up and down lines on the screen with cursor movement
commands.  This requires a bit less screen update overhead, and is
better for slower time shared systems.  If it is zero, the cursor will
remain fixed on ddline, and text will scroll on and off the screen as
needed.  Both these are resettable with the : command. 
 
int dxcase - default search case.  0 means find is case insensitive, 1
means find must match exact case. 
 
int usecz - MS-DOS versions only.  If 1, TVX will put a Control-Z end
of file mark in the file (this is CP/M compatible).  If 0, TVX uses
MS-DOS end of file conventions. 
 
int autoin - TRUE (1) if auto indent, FALSE (0) otherwise. 
 
 
 
                                 -30-
 
 
 
 
TVX Reference Manual                                           2/25/86
 
 
int logdef - Create backup log file by default?  0->no, 1-> yes. 
 
char wildch - The character used as a wild card in finds. 
 
char delkey - the delete character key, usually backspace. 
 
int tvhardlines - number of physical lines on screen. 
 
int tvlins - number of lines on virtual screen.  Initially should be
same value as tvhardlines. 
 
int tvcols - number of columns on screen.  If the terminal wraps new
text to the next line rather than discarding characters after the last
column, then tvcols must be set to 1 less than the true width of the
terminal. 
 
int isibmpc - TRUE (1) if this version uses the custom IBM-PC screen
driver.  FALSE (0) if uses regular terminal output code. 
 
char synofr[20], char synoto[20] - These are used to map commands.
The synofr contains commands to be aliased to the corresponding
command in the synoto table.  For example, the '[' and '{' keys are
often reversed on some terminals.  Making '[' in synofr a synonym to
'{' in synoto will make the two commands the same. 
 
char funkey - If the terminal has function keys, they can be supported
by TVX by setting this variable to the first code sent by the function
key, usually ESCAPE.  TVX supports only two code sequences for
function keys. 
 
char funchar[50] - this is the second code sent by a function key. 
 
char funcmd[50] - this is the equivalent command a given function key
will be mapped to.  Similar to synofr and synoto. 
 
 
*** #define options
 
     The file 'tvx_defs.ic' has many #define statements that can be
used to customize TVX for particular installations.  Ideally, the
source for TVX should be maintained as one set, and differences
between versions handled by #defines.  Most #defines are explained in
the source code, but a few deserve a few extra comments, and are
summarized below. 
 
#define VERSION " - TVX (7/1/85) - " - This defines the version of
TVX.  Any time a modification is made, the VERSION define should be
updated. 
 
#define VB - whether or not to create backup log version or not.  This
does NOT imply the file "backup.log" will be used automatically (see
variable logdef), simply that the code is included. 
 
#define ULBD - If defined, TVX supports underline, bold in ^U, ^B
format.

#define BACKUPNAME - This defines the name of the backup log file, if
used. 
 
#define BUFFLIMIT - This defines how much space is saved in the text
buffer when reading in a file.  This determines how much space is
reserved for saving text with the 'S' command, and how much is left
over for new inserts.  Smaller values allow more text from the file to
be read, larger values allow more text to be saved.  The '-s' switch
at runtime increases this value. 
 
#define FILEREAD, #define FILEWRITE - These define the string used for
file mode in the fopen() calls.  Unix and MS-DOS versions are not
typically exactly compatible, as most MS-DOS C's allow a different
mode to handle the CR/LF problem. 
 
#define FNAMESIZE - maximum length of file names. 
 
#define INT16 - If #defined, then the normal C int is 16 bits long.
This changes the way memory status is displayed. 
 
#define LINELIMIT - Like BUFFLIMIT, only number of lines. 
 
#define MAXBUFF - Defines maximum number of characters allocated to
text buffer.  Malloc() is used to get the space from the runtime
system.  It is possible less than MAXBUFF will be available.  The
maximum allowed for any given system must be less than the maximum
value represented by an unsigned int.  If MAXBUFF is very large, there
get to be a noticeable initialization delay. 
 
#define MAXLINE - This determines the maximum number of lines
allocated per buffer.  It is related to MAXBUFF. 
 
#define REPEATBUFS - defines how many repeat buffers are allocated.
If space is a problem, allocate fewer repeat buffers. 
 
#define USELF - This symbol should be defined if the terminal needs a
line feed character after each carriage return.  Almost always true. 
 
#define FILELF - This symbol is defined if text files use a CR/LF
combination.  It causes a NEWLINE/LF to be written to files. 
 
#define NEWLINE - This defines the actual character used as a new line
in files.  On CR/LF systems, it should be a CR (13).  On systems like
Unix with a single new line separator, it should be that character
(LF). 
 
#define USECTRLZ - defined if the code for handling a Control-Z and
end of file mark should be used. 
 
#define NEEDTVLIB - define this if the standard C library provided
doesn't have the routine in TVX_LIB. 
 
#define HELP - Define this if help should be supported.  The help
routine uses significant space, which can be saved if help isn't
compiled in.

**** MS-DOS Notes ***
 
     TVX can be built as a generic MS-DOS version and as an IBM-PC
specific version.  The MS-DOS version uses the standard DOS character
output routines.  Thus, it could use the ANSI.SYS driver, but it would
run very slowly then.  The IBM-PC version has a custom screen driver
that calls the ROM BIOS directly, and is very fast.  Even more speed
can be had by optimizing the output assembly code (the sysint
overhead).  The definitions for and IBMPC included in "tvx_term.ic"
also define the keypad keys to work in a predictable manner. 
 
 
 
*** Unix Notes ***
 
     The usual Unix version will be the TERMCAP version.  That version
works very well, but is not in all cases optimal for a given
terminal.  It might be desirable to build a specific version for the
terminal you use most often.  Most notably, the TERMCAP version does
not know about cursor shapes or other control sequences to distinguish
command mode from insert mode.  Also, it sets tvcols to one less than
the true value to avoid wrapping problems.  The termcap version also
only sends a bell for the error message.

                        *** TVX File Usage ***
 
     TVX uses four logical files: the original file, the destination
file, a work file, and the source file.  The original file and the
destination file are not touched until a normal exit from TVX. 
 
     The source file is the current copy of the file providing text to
be entered.  When TVX is first started, the source file and the
original file are the same.  The work file is used to hold the edited
output file. 
 
     When the '^B' file beginning command is issued, the remainder of
the source input file is written to the work output file.  The work
file then becomes the new source file, and a new work file is
created.  Thus, it is possible to have four copies of a file around:
The .BAK backup copy of the original file, the original copy of the
file, the copy of the source file, and the (partially written) work
file.  Under normal operation, there will only be two copies: the
source file (which is really the original file) and the possibly
partially written work file.  Only by using the '^B' commands can 3
copies of the file exist. 
 
     When you issue the normal '^X' exit command, the following
actions take place: Any old .BAK files are deleted.  The original file
is renamed to be the new .BAK version.  If the source file is
different than the original file, it will be deleted.  The work file
is then renamed to be the destination file.  If you don't have write
access to the directory with the original file, then the original file
and the work file will not be renamed.  A message to that effect will
be printed.  The normal operating system copy and rename commands can
be used to recover the work file, which contains the edits made to
date.

                 VIX - A vi-like editor based on TVX
 
 
     Vix is an extension to tvx that provides a close emulation of the
Unix editor vi.  While the majority of the common commands are
identical, there are some inherent differences in the way tvx and vi
treat text.  Most of the commands were implemented directly using the
TVX equivalent, although some commands were required new code.  If the
vi command could not be implemented, its command letter was left
unused, and will produce an error message. 
 
     Vix does not have the underlying ex editor, so none of the escape
to ex commands work.  Vix does have the TVX repeat loop, however, and
this compensates to a great extent for the need for ex features.
Please consult the TVX manual for examples of using the repeat loop.
Note that when using the repeat loop with vix, the commands will be
vix commands and not tvx commands. 
 
     Another significant difference is that tvx (and thus vix) treats
the end of line character as just another character.  Thus cursor
movement commands move over the end of line in a fashion one would
expect.  However, when one moves to the end of the line, the cursor is
placed 'over' the newline (displayed after the last real character in
the line).  This makes the '$' command work somewhat differently.
This also means that you can include a <return> in a search pattern.
Vix and tvx use ESCAPE to end the search pattern instead of <return>. 
 
     Vi uses the ':' command to read and write the file (among other
things).  Vix uses the ':' to set operating parameters such as
autoindent, screen size, etc.  The 'ZZ' (or 'ZA' to abort without
changes) command is used by vix to exit. 
 
     Unlike vi and ex, tvx and vix try to load the entire file being
edited into memory (called the buffer by tvx/vix, as opposed to the
yank or save buffer).  If the entire file doesn't fit, the user must
manually 'page' the file in and out of memory manually.  Most of the
'q' ("tvx" prefix) commands are supplied to handle buffer
manipulation.  For more details, consult the TVX manual.  TVX/vix also
uses the concept of the "last thing" as a major editing tool.
Whenever you find a pattern, skip over a word with b or w, save text
into the save buffer with the 'y' or 'Y' commands, or put text from
the save buffer, that text is considered the "last thing".  The 'c/'
and 'd/' commands will delete the last thing.  Entering a new command
will forget what the last thing was until you again enter a "last
thing" command.

                      EMAX - TVX emulating emacs
 
     Important differences: No windows, no marked region, no Q
registers, no word delete or case change, ^K interacts differently
with save buffer multiple keyboard macros (called repeat loops), much
different file and buffer manipulation. 
 
     Partial line ^K's (no argument or 0 argument) will save the
deleted text in the unkill buffer (^CU), but NOT the save/cut buffer.
If an argument is supplied, then the killed lines are save in the save
buffer. 
 
     TVX'x kill last thing concept is implemented as ^C^K. 
 
     Values can be supplied in two ways.  Any of the <esc> commands
may supply a count after the <esc>.  Thus, '<esc>10B' will back over
10 words.  <esc> may also be used to specify the count for ctrl
commands: '<esc>10^N' goes down 10 lines.  The usual emacs '^U' also
works to supply arguments.  It works in the emacs multiples of 4, but
the Arg: count echoes differently.  When you press ^U, then the
message 'Arg: 4' will appear on the bottom.  If you press ^U again, it
will change to 'Arg: 16'.  However, if you enter any other numeric
value, the 'Arg' message disappears, and you get no additional
prompting of values. 
 

 <ctrl-A>    Move to start of line.
n<ctrl-B>    (Back) Move backward by characters.
