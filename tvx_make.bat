REM This is the batch file needed to compile and link the basic TVX using
REM Computer Innovations C-86 compiler.  If you have a different
REM compiler, you will have to make your own batch file.
REM     Once the basic TVX has been made, the other make batch files
REM     should be used to compile the appropriate modules for
REM	the other emulation versions if desired.
REM	This batch file assumes stdio.h is in a directory called \c\.

REM Otherwise, use the following hand optimized version.  Some of the expensive
REM calls to sysint have been replaced with direct calls.  It is much faster
REM than the C version, and is the only case I've ever found that this is true.

REM	Now, link the thing into a file called TVX.EXE
REM	It uses the CII small, DOS 2 library, which is called /c/cslib2
REM	on my system.  You may need to replace the library with whatever
REM	you call the corresponding library (like c86s2s.lib).
